Wrap is an easy to use Swift JSON encoder. Don't spend hours writing JSON encoding code - just wrap it instead!

Using Wrap is as easy as calling `wrap()` on any instance of a `class` or `struct` that you wish to encode. It automatically encodes all of your type‚Äôs properties, including nested objects, collections, enums and more!

It also provides a suite of simple but powerful customization APIs that enables you to use it on any model setup with ease.

## Basic example

Say you have your usual-suspect `User` model:

```swift
struct User {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

let user = User(name: "John", age: 28)
```

Using `wrap()` you can now encode a `User` instance with one command:

```swift
let dictionary: [String : Any] = try wrap(user)
```

Which will produce the following `Dictionary`:

```json
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 28
}
```

## Advanced example

The first was a pretty simple example, but Wrap can encode even the most complicated structures for you, with both optional, non-optional and custom type values, all without any extra code on your part. Let‚Äôs say we have the following model setup:

```swift
struct SpaceShip {
    let type: SpaceShipType
    let weight: Double
    let engine: Engine
    let passengers: [Astronaut]
    let launchLiveStreamURL: URL?
    let lastPilot: Astronaut?
}

enum SpaceShipType: Int, WrappableEnum {
    case apollo
    case sputnik
}

struct Engine {
    let manufacturer: String
    let fuelConsumption: Float
}

struct Astronaut {
    let name: String
}
```

Let‚Äôs create an instance of `SpaceShip`:

```swift
let ship = SpaceShip(
    type: .apollo,
    weight: 3999.72,
    engine: Engine(
        manufacturer: "The Space Company",
        fuelConsumption: 17.2321
    ),
    passengers: [
        Astronaut(name: "Mike"),
        Astronaut(name: "Amanda")
    ],
    launchLiveStreamURL: URL(string: "http://livestream.com"),
    lastPilot: nil
)
```

And now let‚Äôs encode it with one call to `wrap()`:

```swift
let dictionary: WrappedDictionary = try wrap(ship)
```

Which will produce the following dictionary:

```json
{
    "type": 0,
    "weight": 3999.72,
    "engine": {
        "manufacturer": "The Space Company",
        "fuelConsumption": 17.2321
    },
    "passengers": [
        {"name": "Mike"},
        {"name": "Amanda"}
    ],
    "launchLiveStreamURL": "http://livestream.com"
}
```

As you can see, Wrap automatically encoded the `URL` property to its `absoluteString`, and ignored any properties that were `nil` (reducing the size of the produced JSON).

## Customization

While automation is awesome, customization is just as important. Thankfully, Wrap provides several override points that enables you to easily tweak its default behavior.

### Customizing keys

Per default Wrap uses the property names of a type as its encoding keys, but sometimes this is not what you‚Äôre looking for. You can choose to override any or all of a type‚Äôs encoding keys by making it conform to `WrapCustomizable` and implementing `keyForWrapping(propertyNamed:)`, like this:

```swift
struct Book: WrapCustomizable {
    let title: String
    let authorName: String

    func keyForWrapping(propertyNamed propertyName: String) -> String? {
        if propertyName == "authorName" {
            return "author_name"
        }

        return propertyName
    }
}
```

You can also use the `keyForWrapping(propertyNamed:)` API to skip a property entirely, by returning nil from this method for it.

### Custom key types

You might have nested dictionaries that are not keyed on `Strings`, and for those Wrap provides the `WrappableKey` protocol. This enables you to easily convert any type into a string that can be used as a JSON key.

### Encoding keys as snake_case

If you want the dictionary that Wrap produces to have snake_cased keys rather than the default (which is matching the names of the properties that were encoded), you can easily do so by conforming to `WrapCustomizable` and returning `.convertToSnakeCase` from the `wrapKeyStyle` property. Doing that will, for example, convert the property name `myProperty` into the key `my_property`.

### Customized wrapping

For some nested types, you might want to handle the wrapping yourself. This may be especially true for any custom collections, or types that have a completely different representation when encoded. To do that, make a type conform to `WrapCustomizable` and implement `wrap(context:dateFormatter:)`, like this:

```swift
struct Library: WrapCustomizable {
    private let booksByID: [String : Book]

    func wrap(context: Any?, dateFormatter: DateFormatter?) -> Any? {
        return Wrapper(context: context, dateFormatter: dateFormatter).wrap(self.booksByID)
    }
}
```

## Enum support

Wrap also makes it super easy to encode any `enum` values that your types are using. If an `enum` is based on a raw type (such as `String` or `Int`), all you have to do is to declare conformance to `WrappableEnum`, and the rest is taken care of for you.

Non-raw type `enum` values are also automatically encoded. The default behavior encodes any values that don‚Äôt have associated values as their string representation, and those that do have associated values as a dictionary (with the string representation as the key), like this:

```swift
enum Profession {
    case developer(favoriteLanguageName: String)
    case lawyer
}

struct Person {
    let profession = Profession.developer(favoriteLanguageName: "Swift")
    let hobbyProfession = Profession.lawyer
}
```

Encodes into:

```json
{
    "profession": {
        "developer": "Swift"
    },
    "hobbyProfession": "lawyer"
}
```

## Contextual objects

To be able to easily encode any dependencies that you might want to use during the encoding process, Wrap provides the ability to supply a contextual object when initiating the wrapping process (by calling `wrap(object, context: myContext`).

A context can be of `Any` type and is accessible in all `WrapCustomizable` wrapping methods. Here is an example, where we send in a prefix to add to a `Book`‚Äôs `title`:

```swift
struct Book: WrapCustomizable {
    let title: String

    func wrap(context: Any?, dateFormatter: DateFormatter?) -> Any? {
        guard let prefix = context as? String else {
            return nil
        }

        return [
            "title" : prefix + self.title
        ]
    }
}
```

## String serialization

```swift
let data = try wrap(object) as Data
let string = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
```

## Compatibility

Wrap supports the following platforms:

- üì± iOS 8+
- üñ• macOS 10.9+
- ‚åöÔ∏è watchOS 2+
- üì∫ tvOS 9+
- üêß Linux

## Usage

Wrap can be easily used in either a Swift script, command line tool or in an app for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS or Linux.

### In an application

Either

- Drag the file `Wrap.swift` into your application's Xcode project.

or

- Use [CocoaPods](cocoapods.org), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) or the [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) to include Wrap as a dependency in your project.

### In a script

- Install [Marathon](https://github.com/johnsundell/marathon).
- Add Wrap using `$ marathon add https://github.com/JohnSundell/Wrap.git`.
- Run your script using `$ marathon run <path-to-your-script>`.

### In a command line tool

- Drag the file `Wrap.swift` into your command line tool's Xcode project.

### Hope you enjoy wrapping your objects!
